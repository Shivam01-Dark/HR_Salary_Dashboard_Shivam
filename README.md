##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing HR employee salary data using real dataset samples.  
The goal is to clean and structure the dataset, visualize salary variations, and build a predictive model to understand salary behavior.

---

## Tasks Completed
- Cleaned HR dataset (removed duplicates, processed missing values)
- Dataset sanitization & formatting
- Salary trend visualizations for dashboard usage

- Built a Linear Regression prediction model
- Generated charts and stored results
- Prepared final project report

  
### Data Sanitization & Cleaning Performed

- Removed duplicates and formatted salary values
- Handled missing values and incorrect entries
- Converted numeric fields into comparable formats
- Verified structure consistency for modeling
